# Decision-Support-System
A project consists of a set of assignments corresponding to a BI process: data integration, construction of an OLAP cube, querying of the OPLAP cube, and reporting.

# Part 1

In Part 1 of the project, you are required to create and populate a database starting from different files and perform some operations on it. Solve the exercises using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) with computation on the client side (i.e., do not use any SQL command in the nodes, only standard SSIS nodes).

# Part 2

In Part 2 of the project you have to answer some business questions on a datacube you will create on the database you prepared. Document how you build your datacube in your report and solve the business questions using MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX) in SQL management studio.
